# Image Classification using Tensor Flow
- The project demostrates how neural network can be used to train model and classify images using Tensor Flow

In this project I have made use of Tensor Flow to train model to recognize different images based on the data present in dataset. Following are the files that are included in this project:

** Image Classification using Tensor Flow.ipynb **
- This file contains the code which can be used to identify image

** Folder datasets **
- This folder is branched in the following way
|_ new_images
  |_ cats
  |_ dogs
|_ test_images

More folders can be added into the dataset with suffcient number of images for training

#### Tools used
- Data Spell
- Anaconda
- Juypter Notebook

#### Python Libraries used
- numpy
- PIL
- tensorflow
- tensorflow.keras
- keras.layers
- keras.Sequential
- pathlib

#### Images in dataset
Images in the dataset were downloaded from google. Tensorflow only accepts the following extensions 
- JPEG 
- PNG 
- GIF 
- BMP
